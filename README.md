# 4209-roguelite
A roguelite written in C++ and SFML for the second semester of my first year in university.

This project is a basic roguelite written for university. It features several enemies with stealth, mini bosses and a boss battle, procedurally generated maps and a type-writer style text box system. It is a loose prequel to the ASCII shmup I made for my first semester C++ project.
